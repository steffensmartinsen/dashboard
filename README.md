# Dashboard
Welcome to this Dashboard API.

From the [PROG2005](https://www.ntnu.edu/studies/courses/PROG2005#tab=omEmnet) course I already have experience with Firestore and XAMPP SQL database impelemtations. Therefore, I wanted to test MongoDB in this project.

## Planned implementations
<ul>
  <li>Simple frontend home page, and other required pages for navigation. Low priority.</li>
  <li>Weather report for a given location.</li>
  <li>A recommendation system based on a given movie, though the selection of recommended movies will be limited by IMDB's sample API.</li>
  <li>Football statistics for a given team.</li>
</ul>
