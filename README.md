# Dashboard
Welcome to this Dashboard API. The service allows you to register an account, and specify which features you would like to see on your dashboard. The service will then provide you with the requested information.

From the [PROG2005](https://www.ntnu.edu/studies/courses/PROG2005#tab=omEmnet) course I already have experience with Firestore and XAMPP SQL database impelemtations. Therefore, I wanted to test MongoDB in this project.

## Planned implementations
<ul>
  <li>Simple frontend home page, and other required pages for navigation. Low priority.</li>
  <li>Weather report for a given location.</li>
  <li>A recommendation system based on a given movie, though the selection of recommended movies will be limited by the random sample movies included in the MongoDB document.</li>
  <li>Football statistics for a given team.</li>
  <li>The service can register Webhooks for notifications for events happening with their football team</li>
</ul>
